# Whiskey Data Engineering Project 
## retail Store 

In this project, I will create a data architecture for a made-up whiskey retail shop that will enable the shop managers to make decisions based on their data.

The architecture will include various components that will make the decision-making process for the managers as easy as possible.

I’ll start with an ETL process to get whiskey data into the company’s central database. The data is extracted from https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com via web scraping methods using Python.

Ill store the extracted data in a central database, the primary data source inside the organization. Next, design a data warehouse that will extract data from the central database and provide a single source of relevant data for various departments within the organization.

To finish the project, ill get into the shoes of the analysts and create various visualizations that will assist in quick decision making, predictions, and overall understanding of the organization’s situation.
